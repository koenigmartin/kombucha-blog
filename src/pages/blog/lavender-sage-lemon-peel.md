This was one of those recipes that I just could not imagine to taste right. However it did blow me away and is one of my most favourite summer brews until this very day!

# Recipes:

The base recipe that I use during summer times:

* 2g fresh lemon peel
* 0.12g dried lavender flowers
* 0.5g fresh sage leaves
* 3.5g sugar
