  Kombucha making is an easy process, though the outcome is amazing. With only a
  few ingredients you can produce an amazing tasting beverage. The possible
  flavour combinations you can create are basically endless. For me, testing out
  new recipes and flavourings is the most fun, though to be able to also
  reproduce those drinks I started to measure and write down my recipes.

        Getting started: Scoby, starter liquid.


        Basic starter tea recipe: 1 litre water, 3g black tea, 50g sugar beet
        sugar OR 60g cain sugar.


        Bring the water up to 95 degrees celsius and put it off the heat. Add
        the tea and let it rest for 15 minutes. Remove the tea and add the
        sugar.  Wait until the tea is below 30 degrees before using it in the
        first fermentation. 


        Note: as an faster alternative you can only bring half the water to boil
        (and add the ingredients as described above) and afterwards add the rest
        of the cold water to it.

        The First Fermentation ( or F1 for short) is the starting point of each
        and every batch. It consists of three ingredients: a Scoby, starter
        liquid as well as sweetened tea (below 30 degrees celsius!). The ratio
        between starter liquid and sweet tea should be around 1:4 (one part
        starter liquid, four parts sweetened tea. Using enough starter liquid
        will ensure that the liquid is acidic enough so nothing bad can grow
        inside your brew. The F1 will usually take between 7 to 10 days. The
        room temperature should not go below 18 degrees celsius or your Scoby
        will start hibernating and the fermentation will stop. If the room
        temperature goes above 30 degrees the Scoby may die (this is also the
        reason why your starter tea may never be above 30 degrees when mixing
        the F1 ingredients). If the temperature is in between you are fine.
        However you should know that lower temperatures will increase the time
        it takes for the first fermentation to finish. On the opposite side of
        the scale the fermentation will go way faster. With higher temperatures
        there will also be more yeast inside your brews (which in general is not
        a bad thing, however yeast does not look that nice when forming during
        F1).
